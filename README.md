### Description

When it comes to publishing papers, it can be considerably stressful to constantly comb over your SI for any mistakes written in the line listings of countless compounds. To ease this process, I've developed a program for my lab, some time ago, to automatically detect any errors within the written proton and carbon NMR spectra data.

### Misc.

This program will not be expanded upon further. It was originally developed for private laboratory usage but it has now been released publicly for anyone who wants to use, or modify, it to their hearts content. 
You must write your line listing, and an acompanying chemical formula before it, in a text document for this program to function. The line listing must also be in the ACS J. Org. Chem. format. Thank you.
